## About

Ever wonder about what to make for lunch or dinner? You check in your fridge and find nothing that sparks you. Do not worry, our app has got you covered! Just enter in the items currently in your fridge and our app will magically produce a list of recipes you can make! You can also include items you just purchased and our database will store that information for a later use.
